Demonstrating how to implement a RESTserver

This project is a tiny RESTserver and shall illustrate how to write a simple server in Python.


Where to go from here? 
----------------------

I recommend to get a dockerhub account and get your docker image built once the underlying github rep is changing.
It is then trivial to use your (private) docker image on AWS or any cloud service
